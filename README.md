# Shrimp Analysis in Memory of Lilo
 A time series analysis of shrimp prices, for the kitty who passed who loved shrimpies the most. 

This is going to be a rather small analysis overall, with the goal being to create an animated timeline and to put Lilo's face in it somewhere. 

This is a project for me and my grief. I know it may not be the greatest or the prettiest, but I like to think she'd be interested, if only for the hope of getting some shrimpies to chew on. 

I've been learning to weave data analysis into every aspect of my life, this is no different. If you want to learn more about that process, check out my blog:
